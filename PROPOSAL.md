# Flight Simulator Flappy Bird

Author: Amey Venkatanarayan

After all the talk that Proffesor Woodley had of flight simulators in the beginning of the semester, I wanted to create a game that involved these jets that he is so interested in. Thus, I want my final project to be a mock-up of the popular game of Flappy Bird except with the twist that you are controlling a plane traversing through a treacherous cave. Last semester I worked on a very rudimentary version of Flappy Bird, but I was unable to complete as I would've liked. Thus, going off of my work from last semester I hope to create a fully-functioning game that is clearly representative of Flappy Bird.

For this project I inteded on using Cinder alongside an external library known as "OpenGL". OpenGL allows me to ease the process of creating sprites that are not limited by simple geometric shapes and makes the overall view of the project easier on the eye in comparison to the more rudimentary snake project we completed. 

By the end of week 1, I hope to have completed the backend logic behind this game, specifically how a player is to control the plane, how points are earned, and when the game is over. By week 2, I would like to have set up the groundwork for the implementation of graphics and beginning the implementation of the logic alongside the graphics. Finally, if I were to have additional time I would try to maybe add another game mode that would make the game harder (i.e. increasing the speed of the incoming obstacles).
