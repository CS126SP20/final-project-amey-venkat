# Development

**4/20/2020** - Attempted to add SFML external library using CMake, but faced problems causing me to ditch the library for something that was more user-friendly and easier to implement.

**4/21/2020** - Decided on utilizing the OpenGL library which is a part of the Cinder Framework, and created a graphical background using the library.

**4/23/2020** - Added a block that represented the "bird" that could be controlled by the user and naturally "fell" which each respective update in the program to simulate gravity.

**4/29/2020** - Completed implementation of "pipes" that randomly generate to create varying slots for the openings that the "bird" has to traverse through.

**5/1/2020** - "Pipes" now move towards the "bird" which each consecutive frame and there are two pipes in frame at all times.

**5/2/2020** - User earns a point when going through the gap in each pipe and the game is over whenever the user hits a pipe.

**5/3/2020** - Fixed some glitches that caused game to continue despite bird hitting a pipe, and a made the "bird" a image of a plane.

**5/5/2020** - Changed the frame rate so that the game would run more smoothly, and the bird falls more naturally. Depict the user's score on the game over screen. Added basic tests for some of the header files' functions.

**5/6/2020** - Updated the README.md file and added the PROPOPSAL.md file to the project.
