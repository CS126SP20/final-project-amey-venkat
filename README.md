**Flight Simulator: Flappy Bird** is a parody of the popular mobile game, "Flappy Bird", and it uses the *OpenGL* library (which comes included in the *Cinder* framework) that provides graphics capabilities. This game was made as light joke in reference to the numerous references my professor made to his work with flight simulators during lecture.

## Setting Up The Game

As mentioned before, this game utilizes the *Cinder* framework, and you can download the latest version for your platform [here](https://libcinder.org/download).

After downloading *Cinder* (v0.9.2 is the current latest version), extract it into a folder called '~/Cinder'.
